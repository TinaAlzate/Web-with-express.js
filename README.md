# Business Webpage

## :receipt: Generalities 

Business webpage is a product of the HTML, CSS and javascript modules of my frontend postgraduate degree at Universidad la Salle BCN. 

Interactions implemented to highlight on the web: show the weather of your location in real time, set of countries and continents, infinite scroll to load Rick and Morty characters and keyboard shortcuts to navigate.

Additionally, with the prior knowledge of my team we have developed an API, which is consumed through the form, so that when the user 'contacts' on the website, they receive a confirmation email and we also receive an alert email.
